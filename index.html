                  <ol class="dirBox">
                    <li>
                      Step 1: Prepare the dough: - In a mixing bowl, add the
                      milk powder, all-purpose flour, baking powder and ghee.
                      Slowly add the milk, 1 tablespoon at a time, and gently
                      form the dough by mixing. It should be a stiff dough. If
                      the dough is sticky, grease your palms with oil and gently
                      mix. Do not knead the dough—it will make the jamuns hard.
                    </li>
                    <br />
                    <li>
                      Step 2: Let the dough rest : - Cover the dough with a damp
                      cloth. Let rest for 5 minutes.
                    </li>
                    <br />
                    <li>
                      Step 3: Prepare the sugar syrup: - In a saucepan, add the
                      sugar, water and two green cardamom pods, crushed. Bring
                      the mixture to a boil and let the sugar dissolve. When the
                      sugar is completely dissolved, simmer over medium-low heat
                      for 5 to 6 minutes. We need a sticky-consistency sugar
                      syrup here. You can test it by removing a small amount of
                      sugar syrup and letting it cool a bit. Then touch the
                      sugar syrup with your index finger and press it with your
                      thumb. You should feel the stickiness. When it's ready,
                      remove the syrup from the heat and add the rose essence or
                      rose water. Set aside.
                    </li>
                    <br />
                    <li>
                      Step 4: Roll the jamuns: -Grease your palms and pinch a
                      small amount of dough. Roll gently to form a small, smooth
                      ball—to give you an idea of the size, I make about 20
                      jamuns using this recipe.
                    </li>
                    <br />
                    <li>
                      Step 5: Fry the jamuns: -To test the oil, drop in a small
                      piece of the dough. It will sink initially, but after 30
                      seconds or so, it will float up, and the color should not
                      change. That's the right temperature. Slowly drop in 4 to
                      5 balls, depending on the pan size, and deep-fry the
                      jamuns until they turn golden brown. Using a slotted
                      spoon, keep rotating them in the oil for even cooking and
                      coloring. It takes me 4 to 5 minutes for each batch. Do
                      not rush the frying process!When the jamuns are golden
                      brown, use a slotted spoon to remove them from the oil and
                      drain on paper towels.
                    </li>
                    <br />
                    <li>
                      Step 6: Add jamuns to the sugar syrup: -Let each jamun sit
                      for 45 to 60 seconds, and then add the fried jamuns to the
                      warm sugar syrup. Repeat with the next batch of jamuns,
                      frying them and then adding them to the sugar syrup. Let
                      the jamuns soak in the sugar syrup for at least 2 hours.
                      Overnight soaking is fine, too.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      Step 7: Garnish You can eat gulab jamun cold or warm. Put
                      the jamuns in a serving bowl and drizzle the extra syrup
                      on top. Garnish with nuts or rose petals and serve.

                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      Step 1: Take all the ingredients and keep then ready - 2
                      cups besan, ½ cup desi ghee, 1 cup sugar, 5 almonds+5
                      cashews (chopped) and 1 tablespoon magaz (melon seeds).
                    </li>
                    <br />
                    <li>
                      Step 2: Grease a pan or a tray very well with some ghee.
                      You can also line a pan or tray with some butter paper.
                      Take ½ cup desi ghee in a heavy kadai and let it melt.
                      Keep the heat to a low.
                    </li>
                    <br />
                    <li>
                      Step 4: Once the ghee has melted, then add 2 cups of besan
                      in parts. Please use a heavy kadai, so that the besan
                      roasts evenly. Also do not use a non stick pan as there is
                      a lot of stirring involved. When the first portion of
                      besan is added, mix it with the ghee.Then add the second
                      part of besan. Mix it again with the ghee. Initially the
                      ghee will be absorbed by the besan and you will see the
                      mixture getting thicker.The besan mixture will become like
                      one whole lump of mass or you may see it getting thicker
                      and granular. Continue to fry stirring very well. Scrape
                      the mixture from the bottom when you stir.After some
                      minutes of stirring, you will see that the besan mixture
                      starts to become molten and ghee will be released from the
                      sides.
                    </li>
                    <br />
                    <li>
                      Step 5:Stirring non-stop, you will come to a stage where
                      the besan will have a nice golden color and will have a
                      good aroma. Its important to fry the besan very well or
                      else you will get the raw taste of besan in the barfi.
                      Once the besan has roasted well keep the pan down.Add 1
                      teaspoon of cardamom powder. Stir and mix well.

                      sugar, water and two green cardamom pods, crushed. Bring
                      the mixture to a boil and let the sugar dissolve. When the
                      sugar is completely dissolved, simmer over medium-low heat
                      for 5 to 6 minutes. We need a sticky-consistency sugar
                      syrup here. You can test it by removing a small amount of
                      sugar syrup and letting it cool a bit. Then touch the
                      sugar syrup with your index finger and press it with your
                      thumb. You should feel the stickiness. When it's ready,
                      remove the syrup from the heat and add the rose essence or
                      rose water. Set aside.
                    </li>
                    <br />
                    <li>
                      Step 6: Once the sugar syrup reaches a 2 thread
                      consistency, then quickly pour all the sugar syrup in the
                      besan mixture.You have to be quick and fast as the mixture
                      begins to harden.Mix fast and you will see the mixture
                      thickening.The besan burfi mixture will leave the sides of
                      the pan or kadai.When mixed well, quickly pour the besan
                      barfi mixture in the greased pan or tray.Shake the
                      pan.With a spatula even the barfi mixture layer.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      Step 7: Sprinkle chopped almonds, cashews and melon seeds
                      on top.When still warm, slice the besan barfi in cubes or
                      squares. Store besan ki barfi in an air-tight container.
                      No need to refrigerate. Besan ki burfi stays well at room
                      temperature for about a week. Serve it as a sweet dessert
                      after any Indian meal.

                      piece of the dough. It will sink initially, but after 30
                      seconds or so, it will float up, and the color should not
                      change. That's the right temperature. Slowly drop in 4 to
                      5 balls, depending on the pan size, and deep-fry the
                      jamuns until they turn golden brown. Using a slotted
                      spoon, keep rotating them in the oil for even cooking and
                      coloring. It takes me 4 to 5 minutes for each batch. Do
                      not rush the frying process!When the jamuns are golden
                      brown, use a slotted spoon to remove them from the oil and
                      drain on paper towels.

                      Step 1: Prepare the dough: - In a mixing bowl, add the
                      milk powder, all-purpose flour, baking powder and ghee.
                      Slowly add the milk, 1 tablespoon at a time, and gently

                      mix. Do not knead the dough—it will make the jamuns hard.

                      sugar syrup and letting it cool a bit. Then touch the

                      Step 4: Roll the jamuns: -Grease your palms and pinch a
                      small amount of dough. Roll gently to form a small, smooth
                      ball—to give you an idea of the size, I make about 20
                      jamuns using this recipe.

                      Step 5: Fry the jamuns: -To test the oil, drop in a small
                      piece of the dough. It will sink initially, but after 30
                      seconds or so, it will float up, and the color should not
                      change. That's the right temperature. Slowly drop in 4 to
                      5 balls, depending on the pan size, and deep-fry the
                      jamuns until they turn golden brown. Using a slotted
                      spoon, keep rotating them in the oil for even cooking and
                      coloring. It takes me 4 to 5 minutes for each batch. Do
                      not rush the frying process!When the jamuns are golden
                      brown, use a slotted spoon to remove them from the oil and
                      drain on paper towels.

                      Step 6: Add jamuns to the sugar syrup: -Let each jamun sit
                      for 45 to 60 seconds, and then add the fried jamuns to the
                      warm sugar syrup. Repeat with the next batch of jamuns,
                      frying them and then adding them to the sugar syrup. Let
                      the jamuns soak in the sugar syrup for at least 2 hours.
                      Overnight soaking is fine, too.

                      Step 7: Garnish You can eat gulab jamun cold or warm. Put
                      the jamuns in a serving bowl and drizzle the extra syrup
                      on top. Garnish with nuts or rose petals and serve.
